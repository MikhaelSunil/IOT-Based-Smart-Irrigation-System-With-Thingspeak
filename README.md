# IOT-Based-Smart-Irrigation-System-With-Thingspeak
This repository contains the code and resources for an IoT-based smart irrigation system, designed to monitor soil moisture and automate irrigation using Arduino. The system uses the ThingSpeak platform to collect, visualize, and analyze data remotely, enabling efficient water management and plant care.

Features:-
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously tracks soil moisture levels and updates them to the ThingSpeak cloud for real-time data visualization.
Automated Irrigation: Automatically activates a water pump when the soil moisture falls below a predefined threshold.
Remote Control & Analytics: Access and control the system remotely via ThingSpeak, and view historical data trends.
Low Power: Energy-efficient design ideal for long-term field use.

Components:-
Arduino Uno,
Soil moisture sensor,
Water pump relay,
ThingSpeak IoT platform,
Wi-Fi module (ESP8266 or similar)

Getting Started:-
Clone this repository and upload the Arduino code to your board.
Connect your hardware according to the provided circuit diagram.
Configure your ThingSpeak API key and Wi-Fi credentials in the Arduino code.
Monitor your plantâ€™s soil moisture and let the system handle irrigation automatically.
